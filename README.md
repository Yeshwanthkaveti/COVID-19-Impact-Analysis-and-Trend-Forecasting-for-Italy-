# COVID-19 Data Analysis for Italy
This project performs in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic data for Italy. The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the COVID-19 impact over time, focusing on key metrics such as new cases, deaths, testing rates, and trends across different months. The project uses data processing and visualization techniques to help understand patterns in the spread of the virus.

## Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Cleaning and transforming raw data for consistency, such as handling missing values and converting data types.

Metric Calculation: Calculating essential metrics like death ratio, positive rate, and cumulative totals for cases, deaths, and tests.

Trend Analysis: Performing time series analysis to uncover key trends such as daily increases in cases and deaths, along with month-to-month variations.

Data Merging: Merging COVID-19 data with population data to calculate statistics such as cases per million, deaths per million, and tests per million.

Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib to visualize trends, including plotting total cases, deaths, and the death rate over time.

Report Generation: Generating a CSV report with summarized data and insights, including daily and cumulative statistics, and per million calculations.

## Technologies Used:
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Pandas: For data processing and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations and data cleaning.

Matplotlib: For creating various visualizations such as line charts and trend plots.

## Analysis Insights:
The project analyzes daily new cases and deaths, and evaluates the death ratio, positive rate, and trends.

Monthly aggregates allow for comparison between different months' performances.

Visualization of key metrics such as cases, deaths, and positive rates helps to identify critical periods in the pandemic.

## Outputs:
A comprehensive CSV file (italy_covid_results.csv) containing important metrics for COVID-19 in Italy, including daily and cumulative statistics, per million calculations for cases, deaths, and tests.

Visual plots showcasing the trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, death rates, and positive rates over time.
